Security Onion ISO Customization Process
In this repo, we will present a method (one of many) to customize the Security Onion 2.3 ISO.  The reason for this is to bypass certain options and apply new options to the kickstart script (ks.cfg) in order to automate the process of installing Security Onion 2.3 in special circumstances. The circumstances in this case are deploying SO 2.3 to multiple ESXi systems without user intervention.
